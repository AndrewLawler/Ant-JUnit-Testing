# Ant-JUnit-Testing
Build file using Ant (XML) and JUnit (Java) to test our packaged classes

## What is Ant?
Ant is an automated build tool which allows you to write build files in XML which can perform tasks. I have created a build file which created XML and HTML reports for a JUnit test file. This code was created as part of a University assessment.

## How to run?
- Install Ant
- Download Repo and simply cd into dir and run 'ant' and then 'ant -f build.xml test'
